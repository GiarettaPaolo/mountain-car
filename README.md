Comparison of Model-based and Model-free Reinforcement Learning techniques on the Mountain Car Environment. The training characteristics of the following agents are compared, highlighting the main differences:

- Random agent
- DQN with no heuristic reward
- DQN with an ad-hoc heuristic reward
- DQN with [Random Network Distillation](https://github.com/openai/random-network-distillation)
- Dyna (Model-based)
